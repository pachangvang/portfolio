    In a design engineering team of about 15 members, I worked with engineering students from different disciplines. I was the only Human Factors person on the team who had experience with research and human-centered design processes. ⭐Therefore, I led the human factors research and <a href="#pdf" style=" font-weight: normal;

                Second, there were concerns about access to targeted user groups for this project, specifically users from low-resource settings like underdeveloped countries along with limitations on resources that we had available to us.
                Therefore, to combat these constraints, we had to optimize each team’s skill sets which also defined the feasibility of the technology we chose to build. As the research team lead, I had to seek other ways to learn more about users without being able to interview or talk to them directly.

After consolidating these findings, we conducted user research to understand who we were designing for. Again, with no access to our targeted users, we relied on data available online. We also performed a quick market analysis to compare the costs and benefits of different devices and invited experts in for a consultation on our ideas.

                Although the team made some effort to narrow down the problem space, these findings were still very broad with issues ranging from system level to technical challenges. A major theme we noticed is how all of these tied into the ability of healthcare professionals to provide quality care and diagnosis.

Temperature monitoring is crucial to detect early signs of diseases, illnesses, and conditions that are used in diagnosis, therapy, and more. However, patient monitoring devices often require someone trained to use them and a provider nearby to maintain them. Especially in low-resource settings where electricity is expensive, where patients from rural regions may not be able to visit the closest hospitals, or the imbalance ratio of providers to patients, there is a need for continuous, consistent, and noninvasive ways to monitor the temperature when patients are under critical condition.

Heart rate and oxygen levels are also important vital signs that providers need along with temperature to holistically evaluate the patient’s condition. And specifically in the use context that we focused on which is before, during, and after surgery, we recognize how common it is for patients in recovery to fall and get injured. Our main goal is to build an accessible device so we targeted a price of under $100. Portability is imperative for the device since there are limited hospital spaces and storage rooms, and battery-powered to reduce the need for electricity. And with consideration that we want this device to provide continuous monitoring, we would require a wearable element and a simple interface to view the measurements.

Our plan moving forward is to incorporate the sensors, wires, and battery onto the headband. I’m also currently working with the industrial design team to help them factor in ergonomics, user experiences, and potentially some e-textiles in the design. Of course, looking at the prototype, it is nowhere near perfect and some concerns have already come up that we will need testing to further validate.

Since we don’t have access to the intended users, I plan to initiate and lead the research team to conduct a task analysis of the prototype, cognitive walkthrough, and heuristic evaluation. These methods don’t require users and we can still identify some usability issues. Moreover, they can be completed within the hour that we have together as a team and don’t require much training to get started.

            <td>We can also invite industry experts to review the prototype and identify more usability issues based on their experiences. This would be valuable to us since these experts have more knowledge and exposure to patients, providers, and the healthcare system. Ideally, I do want to conduct a small pilot study with patients but due to HIPAA and IRB regulations, that would not be possible. Therefore, I think using members of the team who are not on the industrial design team could be an alternative. We are assuming that most of us have been patients before or visited the doctor’s office before and got our vital signs measured. We could do a simulated use-usability test where tasks are provided for users to complete while thinking out loud. We can even conduct interviews to understand more about specific behaviors or decisions, depending on what we discover. 
                And of course, besides usability tests, the engineering team will conduct benchmark tests to make sure our device is measuring what it’s supposed to.

                The second step is to submit the research and design report with our testing results and working prototype.
                
                Lastly, for me to continue to support the industrial design team and hopefully influence them enough to rethink the form of the prototype.

It was my first time diving into physical prototyping and working with a large group of engineers as the only human factors person. And having our targeted users as patients and providers in other countries posed the biggest limiting factor in the research process.
                However, I believe with the progress we made so far, our device can improve care delivery by continuously monitoring patient’s conditions and detecting early signs of illnesses. This can allow healthcare professionals to provide high-quality care for the large volume of patients they see.
