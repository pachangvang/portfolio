    <h3 class="project-headings" style="padding-bottom: 10pt;">Project Brief</h3>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 10pt;">
        This project was completed during the Co.Lab training program. In a cross-functional team, we decided to continue on building the vision of Festa, a progressive web application (PWA) for Electronic Dance Music (EDM) lovers.
        As the sole product designer on the team, I collaborated with stakeholders to ensure the product‚Äôs vision and goals were met. At the end of the intensive 8 weeks, my team and I delivered a live MVP of Festa, an entertainment aggregator of EDM concerts and music festivals.

    <h3 class="project-headings" style="padding: 20pt 0 10pt 0;">Problem Space</h3>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 10pt; font-size:16pt; line-height: 22pt;"><span class="pop">‚ùùHow might we improve the discoverability of EDM events for fans?‚ùû</span></p>
    <p>There is a huge market for the EDM industry but few platforms focus solely on providing a great user experience for EDM fans. We noticed that <span class="pop">personalization of music events</span> are vital to optimize the user‚Äôs time and value when looking for their next live music experience.</p>
    
    <h3 class="project-headings" style="padding: 20pt 0 10pt 0;">Product Goals</h3>
    <li>Give event recommendations to people based on their preferences (artist and location)
    </li>
    <li>A notification system that reminds people of new events and live tickets on sale
    </li>
    <li>Allow people to organize and keep track of their events
    </li>

    <h3 class="project-headings" style="padding: 20pt 0 10pt 0;"><a href="#prototype">Design Solution ‚Üí</a></h3>
    <p>Our goal is to create a seamless and fluid experience for EDM fans across North America, enabling them to <span class="pop"> discover EDM music and concert events through personalized recommendations</span>, even when they're not actively searching for live music events.
    </p>

    <h3 class="project-headings" style="padding: 20pt 0 10pt 0;" id="solution">‚≠êFilters & Notifications‚≠ê</h3>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20pt;">This tool was inspired by social media platforms enabling users to filter out their content and stay alert when there are new updates coming through. This allows user to take control of what they want to see and increase trust among the user and the platform.
    </p>

    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;">
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20pt;">Within Festa, <span class="pop"> filters and notifications bring the EDM events to fans</span> instead. Events will be shared and easily discovered with all the relevant information they need to make informed decisions.
    </p><hr>

    <h3 class="project-headings" style="padding: 20pt 0 10pt 0;">Project Summary</h3>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20pt;">Due to the fast-paced nature of this training program, my team and I redesigned an initial project by the PM. I surveyed the team to understand each member‚Äôs strengths and skillset to ensure the redesign was feasible to build within 4 weeks.
    </p>
    <img src="./festa/current experience.png" alt="current experience" class="project-image">

    <h3 class="project-headings" style="padding: 20pt 0 10pt 0;">Research</h3>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20pt;">After discussing with the team, specifically the PM, to understand the motive and idea for Festa, I realized that the initial user research piece was missing. There were no user interviews conducted nor market research to understand the business goals and market fit. Moreover, the initial problem space was too broad for our timeline of 8 weeks.
    <br><br>For the next steps, I spearheaded user research via user interviews (2 interviews), surveys (26 responses), and competitive analysis. <span class="pop">I advocated heavily for the user needs of the PM despite the pushback to stick with the initial idea.</span>
        <br><br>View the survey <span class="pop"><a href="https://forms.gle/MYddqV8aRsQt9c768" target="_blank" style=" font-weight: normal;

    <h3 class="project-headings" style="padding: 20pt 0 10pt 0;">Three main discovery pillars for our approach:

    <h3 class="project-headings" style="padding: 20pt 0 10pt 0;">Key Insights</h3>
    <p>Fans often have to rely on social media and word of mouth to learn and discover new EDM events near them. This is not very efficient since they need time to find tickets to purchase and plan for any travel accommodations.
    </p>
    <p style="padding: 20pt 0 10pt 0; font-size:16pt; line-height: 22pt; text-align: center;"><span class="pop">Fans struggle to find events timely.

    <h3 class="project-headings" style="padding: 20pt 0 10pt 0;" id="personas">User Personas</h3>
    <p style="padding: 0 0 10pt 0;">I formed two principle personas to condense our findings from the survey and interviews. This helped in gaining empathy for the end user, gaining perspective in their process, and further <span class="pop"> who our users are, their frustrations and their expectations.</span>

    <h3 class="project-headings" style="padding: 20pt 0 10pt 0;">Competitive Analysis</h3>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 10pt;">What I learned from competitor's products from a SWOT analysis:
    </p>
    <li>There is a huge market for the EDM industry but few platforms focus solely on providing a great user experience of EDM events to users
    </li>
    <li><span class="pop">Personalization of music events is vital to optimize the user‚Äôs time and value when looking for their next live music experience
    </span></li>
    <li>The onboarding stages of a platform determine the user‚Äôs overall experience

    <h3 class="project-headings" style="padding: 20pt 0 10pt 0;">A. Preferences set during onboarding
    </h3>
    <p>The onboarding stage is the first step for users to see and curate the experience they want via personalization of events. From our user research, <span class="pop"> and location are important deciding factor for an event in the early discovery phase.</span>

    <p>I developed a click-through prototype on Figma to conduct 4 usability tests to get an in-depth understanding of how users interact with the new interface. We focused primarily on the mobile version of the application since changes were easier to implement.

    <p style="padding: 30pt 0 10pt 0;">Drawing inspiration from EDM posters and digital ads, I centered the theme colors
        around a dark background with bright colors to mimic the flashy neon lights displayed
        during a night festival. By knowing our target audience, <span class="pop"> we hope to tailor the platform
        visually to compel and attract users.</span></p>

    <h3 class="project-headings" style="padding: 30pt 0 10pt 0;">Next Steps</h3>
    <p>If we were to continue with Festa, these will be our next steps:
    </p>
    <li>Expand the API of the platform to include more diverse events
    </li>
    <li>Increase the scalability of the platform to include a ticketing service and an event planning system (create the entire user experience)
    </li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 20pt;">Provide more event filtering options for users (e.g. price, distance, venue, etc.) <span class="pop"><a href="#filter">‚Ü©</a></span>
    </li>

    <h3 class="project-headings" style="padding: 20pt 0 10pt 0;">Learnings</h3>
    <li>The biggest impact I made was <span class="pop">collborating with my team of PM and software developers to make sure everyone understood our user base and their needs,<a href="#personas">‚Ü©</a></span> often visiting our personas.
    </li>
    <li>I presented my findings often and advocated for the users when there was pushback by <span class="pop">communicating the benefits users can have throughout the entire user journey.</span>
    </li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 30pt;">More importantly, I listened and talked to the developers often to understand their needs and their technical skillset. I incorporated the feedback into my designs without compromising the user experience.
