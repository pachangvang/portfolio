        <p>"Pa Chang was a highly effective intern on the Women's Health project. She <span class="pop">quickly grasped the
            project's context and contributed significantly to research synthesis, report creation, and 
            communication of findings</span> to diverse audiences. She was instrumental in adapting the report for 
            different purposes and even developed a new prototype for ongoing use."</p><br>
        <p>"Pa Chang also excelled at data analysis for Women‚Äôs Health, <span class="pop">summarizing complex information, and 
            creating visually appealing presentations</span> that effectively conveyed key insights. 
            <span class="pop">Her contributions saved the team time and energy,</span> demonstrating her strong work ethic and ability to 
            contribute meaningfully to the project."</p><br>
        <p>"Pa Chang demonstrated <span class="pop">exceptional attention to detail, consistently going above and beyond</span> with 
            her work. She was proactive in seeking out tasks and opportunities to learn, showcasing her <span class="pop">strong 
            problem-solving skills and independent learning abilities.</span> This allowed her to fully  engage in team 
            sessions and contribute high-quality work."</p><br>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 30pt;">"The Women‚Äôs Health project is huge and unwieldy at times as we are executing research methods that have never 
            been done in-house at Highmark before (all while trying to define the problems to solve and build a working 
            relationship with the portfolio team). Multiple phases of the work are happening concurrently. There is a lot of 
            pressure to do this well and right. <span class="pop">Pa Chang has been immensely helpful in driving this work forward.</span> We are a small 
            work group, and  it made a big difference to have support from <span class="pop">someone who is thoughtful, observant, and willing/able 
            to join the fray with grace.</span>"</p>
