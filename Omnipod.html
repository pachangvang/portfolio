                experience of the Omnipod, we focused on impact detection and moisture sensing of
                insulin leaks. We plan to use the ADXL335 accelerometer (which we used in last week's lab)
                to measure and monitor sudden movements of the entire pod. There are multiple
                resources online such as videos, open access codes, and step-by-step instructions that we
                will utilize to connect the accelerometer to the Arduino.

                the Omnipod bandage around the cannula insertion site to detect moisture. An LED can be
                added to the circuit to alert and provide visual feedback to the wearer. This simple system
                is inspired by DIY soil moisture sensors for plants that often use nails or other conductive
                materials as electrodes with a gap to detect moisture. There are other options available
                such as textile sensors that can be used but are often quite expensive.

                accuracy and response time, and 3. data interpretability and usability.
                These 3 parameters revolve around wanting to understand if the new system can detect
                impact and sense moisture within an acceptable range as well as provide feedback to
                users through the usability of the data such that users can understand and interpret the

                accidental impacts, like bumping into doorframes. Users face challenges in discerning if
                blood sugar fluctuations are due to a dislodged cannula or other factors. In the initial
                phase of our project, we explored sketches for a moisture-detecting sensor to be placed
                beneath the Omnipod, aiding users in detecting this issue sooner.
                We first aimed to create a seemingly simple sensor which would be housed between layers
                of protective yet absorbent fabric to detect moisture from the pump, but not from the
                body such as sweat.</td>

                the Arduino and constructing the moisture sensor. Our first test involved using a
                waterproof adhesive bandage material, which prevented moisture detection unless fully
                soaked. Subsequently, we directly submerged two wires into a bowl of water to measure
                the resistance of the moisture sensor. We observed low ohm numbers indicating lower
                resistance with increased water presence. Despite efforts to adjust sensor resistance by
                testing various resistors on the breadboard, we encountered challenges in discerning
                significant differences in resistance between dry and wet conditions, raising concerns
                about sensor functionality. Limited engineering knowledge posed additional challenges in

                accuracy. We conducted simulated use testing with users to measure the usability of the
                new system design. We performed a very simple task-based usability test where users

                gives a reference number in terms of usability of the system. An average of 68 is
                recommended for good usability, and the higher the number, the better.
                We synthesized the recorded times for each task to understand how efficient the new
                system is, especially with the additional step of attaching the moisture sensor to the pod.
                At a high level, you can see that each task took about 30 seconds or less, totaling about 69

                with different populations and age ranges. There was one study that reported the lowest
                SUS score of 58 when testing with novices but the general pattern is to expect a score
                higher than 68. Our SUS score of 80 is well above average and within the range of

                the usability of different insulin devices reported that the Omnipod had a 90% success
                rate and took an average of 167 seconds to complete 5 tasks. Compared to this, we had a
                100% completion rate with an average of 69 seconds to complete 3 tasks and a rating of 2
                for difficulty.
                And lastly, for the accuracy of the moisture sensor, we measure it's accuracy by seeing if it
                lights up or not during usability testing, which it did for all 3 users.</td>

            <td>Lastly, we learned a lot about how complex wearable technology is and had to pivot our
                ideas when faced with challenges. The most important thing we learned is to focus on one
                aspect of the wearable device first instead of trying to do everything.
                The biggest challenge with this project is applying what we learned about conceptual
                physics, specifically electrical circuits, to build a moisture sensor.
                And something we would do differently if we had more time is to test with a larger sample
                of users, improve the prototype so the moisture sensor can be integrated within the pod
                as one unit, and lastly, be able to differentiate between insulin and sweat for moisture
                detection.</td>
