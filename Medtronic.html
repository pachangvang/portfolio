        <li>Independently managed and contributed to <span class="pop">three concurrent projects</span> across different product systems within the Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) portfolio, balancing deliverables and coordinating with multiple cross-functional teams.</li>
        <li><span class="pop">Co-led 33+ formative usability studies (totaling over 35 hrs) of 100+ design concepts with 35 users across 4 iterative testing rounds,</span> generating insights to improve workflows validated by high usability scores (System Usability Scale & 5-point Likert Scales).</li>
        <li>Applied human-centered design through user research and storyboarding to illustrate impacts on Medtronic‚Äôs product ecosystem, leading to submission for the <span class="pop">2025 Human-Centered Design Impact Award.</span></li>
        <li>Championed the <span class="pop">task analysis and use error analysis (UEA)</span> for a new retrieval system of a transcatheter pacing system (TPS), collaborating cross-functionally to define critical validation tasks, propose design mitigations, and deliver human factors recommendations.</li>
        <li>Participated in multiple <span class="pop">Voice of Customer (VOC) events (e.g., Technical Advisory Committee, Japan Advisory Board)</span> to capture user needs and interaction feedback, directly informing system development with a focus on human factors and usability.</span></li>
        <li>Executed data synthesis and insight report-outs to inform key design decisions across <span class="pop">6+ cross-functional teams (systems, software, security, quality/reliability/safety, project management, mechanical engineering, procedure).</span></li>

        <p>As part of a project I co-led during my internship, we submitted our project to the annual Human-Centered Design (HCD) Impact Award Competition held within Medtronic.
            Here's a snippet of the impacts we made on this project!</p>

        <p>"It‚Äôs not often you come across someone as exceptional as Pa Chang Vang. During her <span class="pop">year-long internship on Medtronic‚Äôs Human Factors and User Experience (HF/UX) team,</span> Pa Chang distinguished herself among hundreds of intern applicants‚Äînot only earning a spot but <span class="pop">leaving a lasting impact.</span>
        <br><br>I had the privilege of bringing her onto one of our most strategic design initiatives for <span class="pop">Class II and III medical devices,</span> where she quickly evolved into a deeply trusted teammate. Her contributions spanned the full spectrum of human-centered design: <span class="pop">developing research protocols, moderating sessions, synthesizing insights, and presenting findings to cross-functional partners. </span>She also built high-fidelity Figma prototypes, supported risk documentation, and collaborated seamlessly with engineering, systems, and software teams.
        <br><br>Together, our team conducted <span class="pop">over 35 hours of usability testing with 30+ users,</span> resulting in intuitive, safe, and scalable workflows that <span class="pop">scored 4‚Äì5 out of 5 in user evaluations.</span> Pa Chang‚Äôs work was instrumental in shaping prototypes that advanced our design system and were adopted by other teams for broader use.
        <br><br>She approaches each challenge with discipline, creativity, and a collaborative spirit. <span class="pop">Her ability to balance technical complexity with deep empathy for users is rare‚Äîeven among seasoned professionals.</span>
        <br><br>Pa Chang doesn‚Äôt just rise to the occasion‚Äîshe elevates the team around her. <span class="pop">I would enthusiastically recommend her for any Human Factors or UX design role.</span> She has the mindset, skills, and drive to make a serious impact wherever she goes."
     <br><br><strong>‚Äî Lance Farb (Principal Human Factors Design Engineer | Medtronic)</strong></p><br>
     <hr>
        <p style="padding-top: 20pt;">"Pa Chang has been an outstanding contributor throughout the year long internship. 
            She <span class="pop">consistently demonstrated curiosity, growth, and adaptability.</span> She quickly applied herself to new projects and tasks, <span class="pop">taking ownership of a valuable portion of our Human Factors risk documentation and delivering high-quality results that helped confirm and refine the design.</span> 
            Her collaborative approach helped the team meet aggressive project milestones, and she consistently brought both creativity and decisiveness to problem-solving usability 
            challenges. She is <span class="pop">trustworthy, motivated, efficient, and a pleasure to work with, and she has made a lasting positive impact on both the team and our deliverables.</span>"
