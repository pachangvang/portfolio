        <h3>Some Kind Words</h3>
        <ul>
        <p><em>"Pa Chang recently completed a year-long internship at Medtronic, and we would have loved to continue working with her if we had room on the team. From the start, she showed strong instincts in both UX and human factors work, and <span class="pop">she quickly became someone we trusted to handle important pieces of our research and design efforts.</span>
        <br><br>She approached each study and design task with care, asking thoughtful questions and grounding her decisions in what real users needed. Whether she was preparing research materials, observing usability sessions, or organizing findings, she <span class="pop">consistently produced work that was clear, organized, and genuinely useful to the team.</span> When challenges came up, she stayed steady and found practical, user-centered ways to move forward.
        <br><br>Her communication was steady and respectful, and she worked well with engineers, designers, and clinicians alike. She listened closely, shared her observations in a calm and grounded way, and <span class="pop">helped create an environment where people felt comfortable speaking up and collaborating.</span>
        <br><br>She brings curiosity, follow-through, and a sincere desire to understand and improve the user experience. <span class="pop">Any team focused on UX, human factors, or product development would be fortunate to have her."</span></em>                       
       <br> — <strong>Neal Anderson, Director @Medtronic</strong>
        </p></ul>

        <br><br><ul>
        <p><em>"Pa Chang was a highly effective and reliable contributor to the Experience Strategy & Research Design team at Highmark Health. She <span class="pop">demonstrated a strong work ethic and exceptional attention to detail to learn project content quickly and thoroughly.</span> She was a strong thought leader in helping with the beginning stages of the research strategy through to the end of reporting findings to stakeholders. <span class="pop">The team enjoyed her partnership and proactiveness to share her ideas to advance our work."</span></em>
